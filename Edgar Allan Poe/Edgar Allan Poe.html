                    <h2>A Brief History</h2>


                    <p>Edgar Allan Poe, son of Actress Eliza Poe and Actor David Poe Jr., born 19th of January 1809, was mostly 
                        known for his poems and short tales and his literary criticism. He has been given credit for inventing the 
                        detective story and his psychological thrillers have been influences for many writers worldwide.

                    <p>In 1827 Edgar published his first book, "Tamerlane and other poems" anonymously under the signature 
                        "A Bostonian". The poems were heavily influenced from Byron and showed of a youthful attitude.

                    <h3>The Poe Museum</h3>
                    <p>The Poe Museum. The Poe Museum provides a retreat into early nineteenth century Richmond where Edgar Allan Poe 
                    lived and worked. The museum features the life and career of Edgar Allan Poe by documenting his 
                    accomplishments with pictures, relics, and verse, and focusing on his many years in Richmond. Opened 
                    in 1922, in The Old Stone House, the museum is only blocks away from Poe's first Richmond home and 
                    his first place of employment, the Southern Literary Messenger.</p>

                    <p>I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as the Rhythmical Creation of Beauty.<br/>
                    Its sole arbiter is Taste.</p>

                    <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,<br />
                    Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dreamed before.</p>

                    The leaves they were crisped and sere - The leaves they were withering and sere;<br />

                    Of my most immemorial year.</p></center>

                    <p>Poe suffered from bouts of depression and madness, and he attempted suicide in 1848. In September 
                    the following year he disappeared for three days after a drink at a birthday party on his way to visit his 
                    new fianc√©e in Richmond. He turned up in a delirious condition in a <a href = "https://www.baltimorecity.gov/" target ="_blank" >Baltimore</a> gutter and died on 
                    October 7, 1849.</p>
